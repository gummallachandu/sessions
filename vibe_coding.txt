Build a simple FastAPI + SQLAlchemy backend (reflect the Sakila database, no Pydantic) and a Streamlit frontend.


Requirements:

When I run the UI, it should show all customers by default.

Left sidebar with links: Customers and Films.

In Customers page → list all customers, with two buttons per row:

Details: fetch and show this customer’s films and rental history.

Login as: treat this customer as logged in, switch to Films view for that customer.

In Films page:

If not logged in: show all films, plus a Details button to show availability (total vs rented vs available).

If logged in: show only that customer’s rentals and films.

As logged-in user: allow selecting a film → Rent → insert rental into DB (with rental_date=now, staff_id=1) and update rental history accordingly.

Add a global Logout button in header that clears login and returns to all customers view.
Keep it minimal and simple, matching Sakila schema directly.
